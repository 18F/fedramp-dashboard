124,Total Authorization Count by Package ID not name,"In reviewing the 
https://github.com/truetandem/fedramp-dashboard/blob/master/src/fedramp/home/home.controller.js#L322

I think that line 322 would probably be ` if (p.pkgId && !counted.includes(p.pkgId)) {` as companies such as Microsoft, have multiple products although the same provider name.

I also believe that provider.length probably is sufficient to get this as the `groupby` function in the .gs script is by package id, but you might want to retain this to confirm.

Below is the full function for reference.

- [ ] Change the copy `fonts`, `img` task to just copy these directories from the `node_modules/uswds/dist` directories.  Then remove the directories from the committed repository.

296, Streamline Repository Directory Organization - Recommended,"Some of the directory organization could be streamlined to make the `src => build/dest` pipeline more fluid. Many of these tasks would be contingent on reworking the Gulp tasks outlined in #29.

- [ ] Add `dist` to git ignore.* It looks like `lib`, `dist`, `css` are artifacts of the test suite and the gulp build process, and should be added to the .gitignore, as they do not need to be committed.

- [ ] Move `sass` in to `src`* to make it clear that that is compiled in the build process. 
Move the index.html into `src` as well. This would likely require an update to the Gulp script.
